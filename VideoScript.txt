Hi I'm Andrew.
I love PowerShell
But I miss Bash
So I wrote Sean the Shell.

It's a PowerShell host written in WPF,
so it gives you nice things like 
scalable fonts, copy, paste

It also gives you a more unix-like tab-completion which 
means you don't need to select from a list, 
you just keep typing until you get where you need to go.   

Looking up history is easier too.  

Just type the first few characters of the previous command 
and hit up-arrow.   
If you use PowerShell as I do, continually reworking the 
same set of commands, this really helps your productivity

Did I mention it's in WPF and Xaml?   That means you 
can put WPF objects straight into the output stream.   

Let's insert a datagrid...

$dg = sean-datagrid name,lastwritetime,length,PSIsContainer (dir)
 
And let's see a progressbar

0..10 | % { Write-Progress task subtask -percent ($_ * 10); sleep 1}

It can be handy when writing scripts to have a seperate stream for debug output.  
Let's open one.  Now sean-write-debug can put stuff here without corrupting your
main output.

Sean is available on VisualStudio.com -- just email awf if 
you want to know more.
