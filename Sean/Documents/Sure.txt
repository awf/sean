Sure is a WPF-based powershell host.   Its main property is a clean and simple UI.
Other features:

 * History search (like tcsh and matlab)
 * New custom formatters can be easily inserted in the output stream
 * Bash-like tab completion, with basics (e.g. file completion) implemented in C# for speed
 * Nice progressbar interface
