#1 ARGH:
      $outlook = new-object -comobject "Outlook.Application"
	  $outlook
	says 
	  "A COM object was accessed after it was already released: COM object that has been separated from its underlying RCW cannot be used."

	Fixed by making Runspace MTA

#2 neaten up tab completions with long filenames
      Fixed 1/7/11

#3 fix d[TAB], which has wacky chars
	  No longer observed

#4 completion at space at eol
