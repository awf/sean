Sean is a WPF-based powershell host.   Its main property is a clean and simple UI.
Other features:

* History search (like tcsh and matlab)
* Bash-like tab-completion.   No longer do I have to cycle through hundreds of options, or 
  have to erase the dumbly selected first completion, or have to move from keyboard to mouse 
  to select between two options.
* New custom formatters can be easily inserted in the output stream
* Bash-like tab completion, with basics (e.g. file completion) implemented in C# for speed
* Nice progressbar interface
*	Fast scrolling
* Working CTRL-C
* Inline XAML
* Async debug stream.  Somewhere to send messages that behaves like STDERR but better.
What else could one need?  Run it and see.
